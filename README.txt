This project was created for the Robotics course at Leiden University.
It is important to note that this project is not complete and we
were unable to achieve our goal.

To run the program you will need:
-Keras
-numpy
-math
-OpenCV
-PyBullet

To run the program such that a DQN is used to train the car
to follow a white cube around the basic circular track, run the
command:
	python3 main.py d dqn [number of games]

To train the car using a DQN such that it teachs itself to
drive around the circular track, run the command:
	python3 main.py d dqn_train [number of games]

To test the trained car using the trained DQN model on the oval
track, run the command:
	python3 main.py d dqn_test
	

The code found in yetiborg.py we were not able to test
due to trouble installing keras and tensorflow on our
YetiBorg. This program will load the by the program generated
file dqn_model.h5. It is important ot first train the simulation
before attempting to run this file since it requires the model
generated by the program described above. This file can be run
using the command:
	python3 yetiborg.py
It is important to note that this program requires the ZeroBorg.py
file.
